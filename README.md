Chat X5 is a Chating app with friend or a random person. This app is build using **Native android with Java and Firebase**. Basicaly there are two ways to by which we can chat with a person
* Either by sending him/her a friend request.
* Either by Random chat option.
Random chat option works for all currently online users, which will be shown with no name or profile pic, however if user had previous chats with current profile, then chat will not be cleared and hence it is a total guess for user.
